### What's this?
This is an example for an RCP updatesite (or p2 repository) used right from within a Github repository.

*Note*: The updatesite is taken from a fork of the wonderful [Eclipse-Modern-Dark-Theme](https://github.com/AObuchow/Eclipse-Modern-Dark-Theme)

### URL for the updatesite to be used in an Eclipse-based application
Here's the URL you can use for registering the updatesite in your Eclipse:
